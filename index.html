       I am a UNCC senior chemistry student and this is my home page for the ITSC 1110 course. I took this class to learn a bit about coding and some general applications of it.
       I am graduating in May 2025 and I will be on the job hunt afterwards because of the virtual mountain of debt I have. I think my field will be relatively fun and easier than things I need to do in class because of the software used in most instruments are setup to do the hard work for you to keep things efficient.
       In labs when identifying molecules, it's usually hooked up to databases with measures of how likely it is to a match in said database.
