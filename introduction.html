        <ul>
            <li><strong>Personal background:</strong> I’m from Raleigh, NC and I have 3 cats back at home.</li>
            <li><strong>Professional Background:</strong> I have done work on campus for the chemical stockroom in Burson</li>
            <li><strong>Academic Background:</strong> I am a senior chemistry major</li>
            <li><strong>Background in this subject:</strong> I have very little experience in coding in python for a previous chemistry course, and we were generating certain graphs for different types of energy models</li>
            <li><strong>Courses I’m Taking and Why:</strong> 
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Chem 4900 Directed Undergraduate Research:</strong> This course is required by my major and I like the work we do in the lab and also because I have taken this course previously so I get along well with the people in the research group. It’s a course that you can take as many times as you like with permission from whichever professor runs the research group and isn’t graded traditionally like every other course.</li> 
                    <li><strong>Chem 4111 Instrumental Analysis:</strong> This is a course required by my major and I’m interested in the techniques not taught in previous courses.</li>
                    <li><strong>Chem 4133 Methods of Organic Structure Determination:</strong> This course is required by my major and it will enable me to learn more about the various forms of spectroscopy.</li>
                    <li><strong>ITSC 1110 Introduction to Computer Science Principles:</strong> I signed up for this course to get to full time status and because I figured that knowing some amount of coding is probably helpful personally and professionally.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Funny/Interesting Item about Yourself:</strong> I moved to NC from CT when I was in elementary school.</li>
            <li><strong>I'd also like to share:</strong>  I once played a 2/3 game of rock paper scissors against one of my professors in a previous class in front of the class for a small bonus on the test and got obliterated by them instantly both times</li>
